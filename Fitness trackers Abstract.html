   <th><font color=“color:#93F0C1;”>Fitness trackers and smartwatches have been easily incorporated into physical therapy, acting as vital resources for patients and therapists alike. These gadgets, which come with sensors to track heart rate, movement, and even sleep habits, provide users a thorough picture of their overall health and level of activity. Physical therapists use the information these wearables collect to create individualized workout programs, monitor patient progress, and modify treatment plans accordingly. Furthermore, the information gathered from these devices may be examined over an extended period of time to evaluate long-term patterns, enabling therapists and patients to take an active role in and track the healing process. Essentially, fitness trackers and smartwatches have become essential tools, transforming physical therapy into a tech-enhanced, data-driven experience.</th></font><center>
