   <th>In physical therapy, remote monitoring refers to the use of technology to track and keep an eye on a patient's development outside from the conventional clinical environment. This might involve gathering information on a patient's mobility, degree of activity, and compliance with their treatment plan through the use of wearable technology, smartphone applications, and telehealth systems. Physical therapists who are unable to be physically present for their patients can still offer continuing support and advice to them through remote monitoring, which can enhance patient results and minimize the need for in-person consultations. In addition to saving time and money on trip expenses, remote monitoring allows patients to receive more regular monitoring and individualized coaching.</th><center>
