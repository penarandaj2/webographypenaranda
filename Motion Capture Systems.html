   <th>Motion capture technologies provide a dynamic and accurate way to evaluate and improve patients' movement patterns, which has completely changed the field of physical therapy. These systems track the location and orientation of reflective markers attached to certain body sites in real-time using a network of carefully positioned cameras and sensors. The technology creates an intricate 3D model when patients move in different ways, giving physical therapists the ability to assess posture, joint angles, and general biomechanics with unmatched precision. Through fast adjustments and a greater comprehension of their actions, patients are empowered to actively engage in their rehabilitation thanks to the real-time visual feedback these systems give.</th><center>
